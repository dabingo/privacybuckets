### NEWS

Provides now a class method returning an epsilon for a given target-delta. Previously, only the reverse was implemented. 

Supports now approximate differential privacy, probabilistic differential privacy, Renyi differential privacy, and the ability to construct a bucket distribution from an (epsilon, delta)-graph.

#### The correct choice of number_of_buckets and factor (Voodoo Ritual)
Given two probability distributions distribution_A and distribution_B, we want to evaluate the delta for a given epsilon. For details, see [1] and [2].

The number_of_buckets defines the number of discretization steps the probability mass of events o of distribution_A will be distributed over, according to the privacy loss 

    L_A/B(o) = log  Pr[o <- distribution_A] / Pr[o <- distribution_B]. 

The logarithm of the factor ( log(factor) ) is the discretization step that each of the buckets spans. The probability-mass of events o of distribution_A that fall within the same discretization step will be put in the same bucket. The bucket_distribution is an array of consecutive buckets and can handle everything with a privacy loss 

    L_A/B(o) in [-log(factor)*number_of_buckets/2, log(factor)*number_of_buckets/2]. 

Everything that does not fit in the bucket_distribution array of consecutive buckets of length number_of_buckets will be put in the infinity_bucket if the privacy loss is too big, or in the minus_n bucket if the privacy loss is too small respectively. The number_of_buckets and the factor have to be chosen such that the mass in the infinity (and/or minus_n) bucket is acceptable for the required computational performance. 

For beginners, it is fine to set the number_of_buckets to 100'000. This is sufficient for most scenarios. 

The factor, however, should be chosen carefully. Let the factor be arbitrary but fixed, then the probability mass of distribution_A of all events o with 

	L_A/B(o) > log(factor) * number_of_buckets / 2 

will land in the infinity bucket. Similar for the minus_n bucket. The 2 comes from the fact that half of the buckets handle the case where L_A/B(o) < 0. Therefore, choose the factor according to the acceptable probability mass outside the buckets (that will, under composition, contribute to the error exponentially):
	
        max( |max_loss|, |min_loss| ) < log(factor) *  number_of_buckets / 2

    <=> factor = exp( max( |max_loss|, |min_loss| )  * 2 /  number_of_buckets )
 	
 with  
      
      max_tolearable_infty_bucket   = Pr [  L_A/B(o) > max_loss, o <- distribution_A ] 
      max_tolearable_minus_n_bucket = Pr [  L_A/B(o) < min_loss, o <- distribution_A ] 

For more details, see the examples\*.py provided, and [1] and [2]. 

If yout want to improve or automate the factor search, there is a helpfull insight given in [2]. It states that all bucketd_distributions converge towards a Gaussian distribution quite quickly under composition. The shape of this Gaussian is completely defined by the mean and variance of the initial bucket_distribution. Moreover, this work gives a precise and numericly stable formula to esimate the tail of such a Gaussian under composition without the need of convolving the bucket_distribution. Using this knowledge, the amount of probability mass that will end up in the infinity_bucket can be estimated. 

Another improvement based on the moving Gaussian-shaped bucket-distribution might be to let the bucket-distribution move with the mean of the composed privacy loss distribution (such that the mean is always in the middle of the in-memory bucket_distribution, saving a lot of computations and memory).
